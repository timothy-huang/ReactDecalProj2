Prompt: Spotify Client

# Abstract:

Our app uses the Spotify APIâ€™s Search and Recommendation endpoints in order to search, filter through, and recommend tracks based on attributes such as acoustics, duration, energy, instrumentalness, etc. Users are able to easily adjust these attributes using sliders and will be able to playback tracks.

# Components:

Left Container
- Filter Sliders

Right Container
- Search Bar
- Song Card

Playback Bar
- Playback Buttons
- Playback Tracker
- Stretch: Info Card
- Volume Slider

# Features:

Our app plans on providing three main features:
Song Search: Users will input keywords and be presented with search results containing those keywords.
Song Filtration: Using song attributes, we will filter through search results such that users only see music that satisfy the filters.
Song Playback: Users will be able to playback the songs they find and listen to them.
